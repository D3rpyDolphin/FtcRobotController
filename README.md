This is the code for the 2021-2022 competition.

The main module of the code can be found [here](https://github.com/D3rpyDolphin/FtcRobotController2020-21/tree/master/TeamCode/src/main/java/org/firstinspires/ftc/robotlib).

The main improvements on this years code where improved modularity, particularly because of the inclusion of a command structure. We decided to use FTCLib as it not only followed command structure but was generally more beginner friendly than the FTC SDK while offering valuable tools in automation such as PID controllers.

Note: some code has not been commited recently because it remains unfinished.
